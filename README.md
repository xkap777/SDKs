I created this for placing multiple images on a page in InDesign. It will apply it globally or as seperate groups and you can even specify how many copies of each image per group (max9). it will generate new pages as needed. It can keep groups separate or even keep individual sizes seperate withing a group or even in global settings if you only have one batch to work on. It will also apply marks for trimming and it will add bleed marks if desired. This is a work in progress so any problems let me know.
